I've created the discount calculator program with the calculate_discount() function as requested. Here's how the program works:

The calculate_discount() function takes two parameters:

price: The original price of the item
discount_percent: The discount percentage to potentially apply


If the discount percentage is 20% or higher, it calculates and applies the discount.
Otherwise, it returns the original price unchanged.
The main program:

Prompts the user to enter the original price and discount percentage
Validates that the inputs are positive numbers
Uses the calculate_discount() function to determine the final price
Prints whether a discount was applied and the final price



To run this program, execute it in a Python environment, and it will prompt you for the necessary inputs. The output will show whether a discount was applied and the final price
